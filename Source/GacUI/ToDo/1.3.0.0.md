## Depriorized

- `GuiRemoteController` Reconnecting
  - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Especially during the first connection, it is observed in GacJS that when it is the first renderer and failed during connection ballbacks, Core can't respond to other renderers again.
  - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- Unit Test: Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility. (has workaround)
  - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
  - Active top level menus (in a menu bar) without `Alt` property assigned.
    - Investigate about menu bar accepting tab actions. It appears on Windows tab menu buttons could have focus.
    - When a menu bar is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and pass it to the next control after ending.
    - When a menu is activated by `[TAB]`, keep pressing `[TAB]` will go through all menu buttons and repeat, until `[ESC]`.
    - `[SPACE]` or `[ENTER]` selects a highlighted menu button when tabbing.
  - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.

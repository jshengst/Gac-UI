# 1.3.0.0

## Milestone

- `GuiDocumentViewer` and `GuiDocumentLabel`
  - In the constructor a struct of configration is required, and it will not be changed after the control is created:
    - `AllowScrollBars`
      - It must be false for `GuiDocumentLabel`, which means it will be ignored.
      - When it is true, display scroll bars accordingly.
      - When it is false, content automatically scrolls with cursor changing by user input. When `Paragraph` is `Singleline`, the height is fixed.
  - `PasteAsPlainText`
  - `PasswordChar`, set to `\0` to disable 
  - `WrapLine`
    - `IGuiGraphicsParagraph` already allow line wrapping, it is time to test!
  - `ParagraphMode`
    - `Singleline`: only one paragraph is allowed, only one line is allowed in the first paragraph.
    - `Multiline`: only one line is allowed in each paragraph.
    - `Paragraph`: no limitation.
    - When the document is assigned directly, lines or paragraphs could be joined into one single line according to this property.
    - For `Multiline` paragraphs are parsed/joined with one CrLf. Meanwhile `Paragraph` is one between lines and two between paragraphs.
  - `ParagraphPadding`
- `GuiDocumentLabel` always expands to display all contents, while `GuiDocumentViewer` just clips.
- Predefined settings:
  - DocumentBox/DocumentLabel: AllowScrollBars(false), PasteAsPlainText(false), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(true), ParagraphMode(Paragraph), ParagraphPadding(5).
  - DocumentViewer: AllowScrollBars(true), PasteAsPlainText(false), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(true), ParagraphMode(Paragrapg), ParagraphPadding(5).
  - SinglelineTextBox: AllowScrollBars(false), PasteAsPlainText(true), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(false), ParagraphMode(Singleline), ParagraphPadding(0).
  - MultilineTextBox: AllowScrollBars(true), PasteAsPlainText(true), PasswordChar(0), WrapLine(false), ParagraphMode(Multiline), ParagraphPadding(0).
  - SinglineTextBox and MultilineTextBox are both DocumentViewer.
- Remove dependency to `VlppParser`.
- Delete `GuiSinglelineTextBox` and `GuiMultilineTextBox`.
- Delete `GuiColorizedTextElement`.

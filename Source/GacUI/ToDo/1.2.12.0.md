## Milestone

- GacUI
  - `<RawRendering/>` element.
    - In HTML, it would open a `<div/>` and you can do whatever you want using JavaScript.
- JavaScript rendering:
  - Delete all `GacJS` code. This repo will be used to implement the HTML logic.
  - A codegen for remote protocol and print TypeScript code.
  - In the test project, C++ side will start a HTTP service on Windows (`RemotingTest_Core`).
  - JavaScript side will separate the rendering and the network protocol.
  - Try DOM.
  - Try Canvas.
    - https://github.com/WICG/canvas-formatted-text/blob/main/README.md
      - layout provider could not be done until this is implemented.
  - Try EsBuild to replace WebPack.
  - The experiment will only run a very simple UI that covers all implemented remote protocol so far.
- Ensure build woriflow tutorials.

    - In remote protocol, it is an element with no extra properties.
- Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
  - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
  - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- `GuiRemoteController`
  - Reconnecting
    - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- `RemotingTest_Core` and `RemotingTest_Rendering_Win32`
  - [x] [NamedPipe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ipc/named-pipe-server-using-overlapped-i-o)
    - Implement `-pipe` argument on two projects
  - [ ] [HttpServer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/http/using-http-server-api)
    - Allow only one client by verifying a random guid in the message which is given from the registration request.

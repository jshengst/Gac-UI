# TODO

## Completed but not released (1.2.11.0)

## Known Issues

- Replace `LoadLibrary` with `GetModuleHandle` in `EnableCrossKernelCrashing`.
- `GuiVirtualRepeatCompositionBase`.
  - Eliminate double `ForceCalculateSizeImmediately()` calls in `TestCompositions_VirtualRepeat.cpp` (TODO) and related files.
- FakeDialogService
  - `FakeDialogServiceBase::ShowModalDialogAndDelete` place the window in the center of `owner` instead of the screen.
  - Specify multiple extensions in one filter, exactly like Win32 API.
  - Extensions not applied before checking file existance.
- Expanding collapsing tree nodes cause the whole list to rebuild, which glitch during multiple passes of layout.
  - Only affected items need to rebuild.
- Bindable list control (optional)
  - When a property referenced by `<att.XXXProperty>` is updated, the list item is not refreshed.
    - Need to find a way to listen to the event.
- For all list controls, adding item could cause flashing during rendering for about 1 flame.
  - If this issue is solved, remove document in `Breaking changes from 1.0` and `List Controls`.
- `controller(Unr|R)elatedPlugins` in `IGuiPlugin(Manager)?` lower dependency safety.
  - Change `GUI_PLUGIN_NAME` to `GUI_PLUGIN_CONTROLLER_(UN)RELATED`.
  - Remove the two parameters from `IGuiPlugin`, the macro above already specified it clear enough.
  - Unrelated plugins are not allowed to depend on related plugins.

## Known Issues (Unit Test)

- Tests that assuming DarkSkin:
  - `(H|V)(Tracker|Scroll)/Mouse`
  - `ToolstripSplitButton`
  - `GuiDatePicker/Mouse`
- Tests that are OS awared:
  - `GuiDatePicker`, `GuiDateComboBox`, inject unit test specific time and locale object. Otherwise Window and Linux will see different printed date in snapshots.
- Same issue
  - `(H|V)(Tracker|Scroll)/Mouse`
    - when `Drag to Center` the handler should be highlighted, because the mouse is right above the handler.
  - `GuiBindableDataGrid/ComboEditor`
    - When a data grid cell editor is created under the mouse, the editor does not receive `MouseEvent` event.
- `GuiScrollContainer`
  - Only calling `Set(Horizontal|Vertical)AlwaysVisible(false)` doesn't make scrolls disappear. `SetVisible(false)` on scrolls are verified called.
  - When the content is changed, configuration needs 2 idle frames to be correctly configured.
- `GuiListItemTemplate/ArrangerAndAxis(WithScrolls)`
  - items are not aligned to proper corner when scrolls are invisible.
- Stop hard-coding coordinates:
  - `GetListItemLocation`.
  - `GuiToolstripMenuBar/Cascade/ClickSubMenu`'s `Hover on File/New` try to avoid specifying relative coordinate just because half of the menu item is covered.

## Release (optional)

- GacUI Binary Resource (when new features are added)
  - Upgrade GacUI XML Resource to 1.3, force on all resources instead of only depended or depending resource.
  - Require binary pattern "[GXR-1.3]" at the beginning of the binary resource.
  - Resource compiler and loader will check the version and only accept 1.3.

## Release Milestone (1.2.11.0)

- GacUI
  - Fix `Global Objects` in `GacUI.h`.
  - Thinking about promote SyncDom data structures for unit test, and complete a diff algorithm.
    - Unit test framework
      - Generate `domId` for each dom node:
        - root = 0
        - element = (element.id << 2) + 1
        - virtual = (element.id << 2) + 2
        - hittest = (composition.id << 2) + 3
          - the renderer maintaining an increasing id, when one is allocated it is cached in the composition
      - Diff algorithm based on `domId`
      - Mouse wheel trigger functions.
    - Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
      - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
      - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- Remote protocol redirection back to native rendering:
  - In the test project, C++ side will expose the remote protocol via dll.
  - Implement the remote protocol on a native `INativeController` instance.
    - It could not be used on `GuiHostedController` or `GuiRemoteController`, which is not a native implementation.
  - The experiment will only run a very simple UI that covers all implemented remote protocol so far.

## Release Milestone (1.2.12.0)

    - In remote protocol, it is an element with no extra properties.
    - In HTML, it would open a `<div/>` and you can do whatever you want using JavaScript.
- JavaScript rendering:
  - Delete all `GacJS` code. This repo will be used to implement the HTML logic.
  - A codegen for remote protocol and print TypeScript code.
  - In the test project, C++ side will start a HTTP service on Windows.
  - JavaScript side will separate the rendering and the protocol.
  - Try DOM.
  - Try Canvas.
    - https://github.com/WICG/canvas-formatted-text/blob/main/README.md
      - layout provider could not be done until this is implemented.
  - Try EsBuild to replace WebPack.
  - The experiment will only run a very simple UI that covers all implemented remote protocol so far.
- Copy control unit tests, snapshots and snapshot viewer to `Release` repo.

    - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
    - `Gui(Bindable)TextList` cannot check or uncheck items by key (enter and space).
    - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.
    - Active menus without `Alt` assighed (`TAB` and arrow keys?).
    - `GuiDateComboBox` does not receive focus property, so that when open year/month combo by `ALT` or mouse, list item cannot be selected only by key.
      - Add `Alt` and fix `Mouse` test cases after this is fixed.
- Sample unit test project included in release.
  - Reflection enabled

## Release Milestone (future releases)

- Strict check in different for-each loops.
- A new non-XML instance format
- `<eval Eval="expression"/>` tags.
- `<ez:Layout/>`
  - `xmlns:ez` by default:
    - `presentation::composition::easy_layout::GuiEasy*Composition`
    - `presentation::composition::easy_layout::GuiEasy*Layout`
  - A `vl::presentation::composition::easy_layout::GuiEasyLayoutComposition`
    - with properties:
      - `Top`, `Bottom`, `Left`, `Right`: boolean of border visibility
      - `Padding`: thickness of border and between all leaf containers
    - accepting following tags as child:
      - `<ez:Top/>`, `<ez:Bottom/>`, `<ez:Left/>`, `<ez:Right/>`, `<ez:Fill Percentage="1">`: Will be implemented by stack or table
      - `<ez:Row RowSpan="1" ColumnSpan="1"/>`, `<ez:Column RowSpan="1" ColumnSpan="1"/>`: will be implemented by table
    - properties of other `ez:` object
      - `Padding`, `-1` by default means inheriting the value from its parent, defining a new padding of its children
  - Any `ez:` layout could have multiple `ez:` layout or one control/Composition
    - Such `control` or `composition` will get `AlignmentToParent` changed in `BuildLayout` if all components are `-1` at the moment
    - A flag will store into such object, so the second call of `BuildLayout` will know the value is set by itself, and update it propertly
      - Such flag could be the `<ez:Layout/>` itself passed to calling `SetInternalProperty`
  - There is no constraint about the number and their order of `ez:` child object
    - All consecutive rows or columns will be grouped into a table
    - All direct child of rows of a rows, or columns of a column, are flattened
    - Use stack if possible
  - A `BuildLayout` method will be called after the layout tree is prepared. Changing the layout tree will not take effect without calling this method.

## OS Provider Features

- Windows
  - `INativeImage::SaveToStream` handle correctly for git format. It is possible that LoadFromStream need to process diff between git raw frames.
- UI Automation.

    - DataGrid: swap column object, cells are changed due to binding.
- ListView.
  - Make a common template base class for `IItemProvider` implementation of bindable and non-bindable pair of the same virtual control:
    - The template argument would be the base class which implements the differences.
    - `list::TextItemProvider` vs `GuiBindableTextList::ItemSource`.
    - `list::ListViewItemProvider` vs `GuiBindableListView::ItemSource`.
      - Extends to `list::DataProvider`.

  - `GuiBindableTreeDataGrid`:
    - Offer a default group header row visualizer when users only need one level of collapsable `GuiBindableDataGrid`.
    - Replace the new `list::DataProvider`'s base class with `tree::NodeItemProvider` offering `GuiBindableTreeView::ItemSource` to make a useful data source.
- Upgraded Code editor (need VlppParser2)

  - Add a static setter to `DarkSkinPalette`.
    - A window can be called to update all its controls' and components' template.
    - The above function will be called inside the setter.
- `INativeWindow` add callback for state changing.
  - Including `MaximizedBox`, `MinimizedBox`, `Border`, `SizeBox`, `IconVisible`, `TitleBar`, `Icon`, `Title`, `SizeState`.
  - In `GuiControlHost` or `GuiWindow`, setting border or state doesn't update the control template, it is updated in that callback.
  - Delete `GuiControlHost` and `GuiWindow`'s `OnVisualStatusChanged`.
- FakeDialogService
  - message box disable `X` button if `Cancel` is not in the button list or `OK` is the only button.
- GDI
  - Big cursor of document empty line (GDI)
  - In hosted mode, non-main window doesn't shrink when moving back to low DPI monitor.
- Hosted
  - When dragging left/top border if the main window, the window move if the size is smaller than the minimum size.
- Rewrite calculator state machine demo, when "+" is pressed, jump into "WaitingAnotherOperandForPlus" state machine, instead of storing the operation in a loop. So there will be no loop except for waiting for numbers.
- Check makefile for ParserGen/GlrParserGen/CodePack/CppMerge/GacGen
  - Write maketools.sh
- Add `MoveToScreenCenterAfterLayout` as what is done in `FakeDialogServiceBase::ShowModalDialogAndDelete`.

- Use collection interfaces on function signatures.
  - Only if `Vlpp` decides to add collection interfaces.

## GacUI Resource Compiler (unplanned releases)

- Consider `-ani` binding, create an animation controller object that change the binded property, with predefined interpolation and other stuff.
  - All types that can do interpolation are value types, consider following formats:
    - "NAME:initial value"
    - "NAME(initial value in expression)"
    - Need to be consistent with animation object
  - Consider multiple `-ani` batch control, state configuration and transition, story board, connection to animation coroutine, etc.

## GacUI Resource Compiler (unprioritized)

- In the final pass, only workflow scripts are printed.
  - Use WorkflowCompiler.exe to do codegen externally.
- Remove all loader implementation, enabling custom control types from developers.
  - Try not to include `GacUI.cpp` if `VCZH_DEBUG_METAONLY_REFLECTION` is on.
  - `mynamespaces::VirtualClasses_X` for adding virtual classes deriving from `mynamespaces::X`.

    - searching for correct default control templates.
- Incremental build inside single resource.
  - Calculate dependencies by only parsing.
  - Cache workflow assembly per resource in file.
  - Codegen c++ from multiple workflow assembly.

    - **AddChild**: Accept a child facade or a child object.
    - **ApplyTo**: Accept a parent object, which is not a facade.
    - **Initialize** (optional): Called on the instance object between construction and `<ref.Ctor>`.
  - A facade could have properties but only accept assignment or `-eval` binding.
  - A facade could have an optional **InstanceFacadeVerifier** executed on GacGen compile time.
  - Built-in Layout and Form facade.
  - If `<XFacade>` or `<x:XFacade>` is an accessible and default constructible object, then `<X>` or `<x:X>` triggers a facade.

## New C++/Doc Compiler based on VlppParser2

## GacStudio

- Run the editing GUI using remote protocol.
- Run the symbol server in a separate process.
  - e.g. for rendering if all properties in a binding expression is observable, providing fast editing tool.
- Dedicated solution-project(dependency,external dependency)-item file format.
  - Solution builds GacUI.xml
  - Project builds GacUI XML Resource index file.
  - Each file contains only one item.
